Inspired by all these annoying software pieces that still let me get distracted and also usually didn't work 
anyway. Thank you, because making this has been fun.

Feature to come:

	Soon: Put in your own numbers, of course.
	Later: Put in number of questions, passages, etc. Program will generate correct timer.
	Latest: Put in structure of test taking opportunity. Program will prompt to move on from each part 
appropriately.
